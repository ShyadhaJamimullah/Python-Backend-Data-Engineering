## Day 4 — Loops, Functions, and Modular Thinking

This folder contains Python programs written as part of Day 4 learning: Loops, Functions, and Modular Thinking. These tasks helped me understand how to break problems into functions, reuse logic, and control program flow using loops.

### Concepts Covered

The following core Python concepts were learned and practiced through these programs:

- for and while loops

- break and continue

- Functions

- Parameters and return values

- Default arguments

- Lambda functions

- Basic recursion (conceptual understanding)


### Programs Included

**1. Number Guessing Game**

A menu-driven game with admin mode and user mode.

**Key Features:**

- Admin sets the number range and attempts

- Random number generation

- User guesses with hints (high / low)

- Win or lose based on attempts

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- Functions (admin(), user())

- for loop with else

- break statement

- Global variables

- random.randint()

- Conditional logic

**2. Attendance Tracker**

A function-based system to manage student attendance.

**Key Features:**

- Add students to database

- Mark attendance by date

- Weekend validation

- View attendance records

- Eligibility check based on attendance count

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries

- Functions with parameters

- datetime.strptime()

- while loop

- Conditional statements

- Modular code design
  

**3. Functional Calculator**

A calculator where each operation is handled by a separate function.

**Supported Operations:**

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

- Modulus and power

- Square and square root

- Expression evaluation

- Percentage calculation

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- Functions for each operation

- Loops for handling multiple inputs

- Exception handling (try / except)

- math module

- eval()

- Menu-driven program structure
  

**What I Learned**

- How loops control program flow

- How to write reusable functions

- How to split large programs into smaller modules

- How functions improve readability and maintenance
