## Day 1 — Python Basics and Problem Solving

This folder contains a few small Python programs written as part of Day 1 learning: Python Basics and Problem Solving.
These tasks helped me understand how Python works at a basic level and how simple logic can be used to solve real-world problems.


### Concepts Covered

The following core Python concepts were learned and practiced through these programs:

- Python introduction and real-world use cases

- Python installation and virtual environments

- IDE setup and basic debugging

- print() statements and comments

- Variables and data types

- Type casting

- Taking user input using input()

- String basics

- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)


### Programs Included

**1. Student Marks Manager**

This program takes a student’s marks in three subjects (DBMS, DSA, and OS), calculates the average, and assigns a grade based on the result.

**Grade Logic:**

- Average ≥ 85 → A

- Average ≥ 70 → B

- Average ≥ 50 → C

- Below 50 → Fail

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- input() – to get user input

- int() – to convert input to integers

- Arithmetic operators (+, /)

- print() – to display the result
  

**2. Password Strength Checker**

This program checks how strong a password is based on simple rules like length, digits, and uppercase letters.

**Strength Rules:**

- *Weak:* Very short and no special conditions met

- *Medium:* Some conditions met

- *Strong:* Contains at least one digit and one uppercase letter

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- input() – to read the password

- len() – to check password length

- str.isdigit() – to check for digits

- str.isupper() – to check for uppercase letters

- print() – to display password strength
  

**3. File Analyzer (Word & Line Count)**

This program reads a text file and counts how many lines and words it contains.

**Features:**

- Reads data from a file

- Counts total lines

- Counts total words

**Concepts and Functions Used:**

- open() – to open the file

- read() – to read file content

- splitlines() – to separate lines

- split() – to separate words

- len() – to count lines and words

- print() – to display the results
  

**What I Learned**

- How to write basic Python programs from scratch

- How to take input and make decisions using conditions

- How strings and files work in Python

- How to think logically while solving simple problems
