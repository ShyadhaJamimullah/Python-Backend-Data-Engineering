## Day 3 — Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

This folder contains Python programs written as part of Day 3 learning: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.
These tasks helped me understand how Python data structures are used to store, update, and manage data efficiently.

### Concepts Covered

The following core Python concepts were learned and practiced through these programs:

- List operations

- Tuple immutability

- Dictionary CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Nested data structures

- List and dictionary comprehensions


### Programs Included

**1. Shopping Cart System**

A menu-driven program that manages products, stock, and billing using dictionaries.

**Key Features:**

- Add and view products

- Add items to cart

- Update stock automatically

- Remove unavailable products

- Display grand total at exit

**Concepts and Methods Used:**

- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries

- input(), int()

- in keyword for lookup

- dict.pop()

- while loop and conditional statements
  

**2. Student Record Manager**

A simple system to manage student details such as ID, name, and marks.

**Key Features:**

- Add new student records

- View individual or all records

- Update student details

- Delete student records

**Concepts and Methods Used:**

- Dictionaries for data storage

- Nested key-value pairs

- dict.update()

- dict.pop()

- Conditional statements and loops
  

**3. Even/Odd Number Filter**

This program separates even and odd numbers from a user-provided list.


**Concepts and Methods Used:**

- Lists

- List comprehension

- filter() function

- lambda expressions

- Modulus operator (%)

**What I Learned**

- How lists, tuples, and dictionaries work in Python

- Managing real-world data using nested dictionaries

- Performing CRUD operations on dictionaries

- Writing cleaner code using comprehensions and filters
