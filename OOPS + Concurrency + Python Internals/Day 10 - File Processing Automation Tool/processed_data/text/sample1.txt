Python is a high-level programming language designed for readability and simplicity.
It supports multiple programming paradigles including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and scripting.
The language provides extensive standard libraries and third-party modules.
Threading in Python is useful for I/O-bound operations like file handling and network calls.
Multiprocessing is preferred for CPU-intensive tasks due to the Global Interpreter Lock.
Asynchronous programming allows concurrent execution using event loops.
Understanding concurrency helps build efficient and scalable systems.
Good code structure improves maintainability and readability.
Learning Python deeply requires practice and experimentation.
