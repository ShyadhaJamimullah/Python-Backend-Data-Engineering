## Employee Management System Projects

This repository contains two Python projects demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming for managing employees.

### Task 1: Basic Employee Management System

A console app to manage employees with simple OOPS principles.

**Key Features**

- Add, view, update, and delete employee records.
- Separate classes for Admin, Manager, and Employee.
- Data stored in employee.json.
- Safe operations with exception handling.

### Task 2: Role-Based Employee Management System

Builds on Task 1 with login authentication and role-based access.

**Key Features**

- Login using username and password (auth.json).
- Admin → full control, Manager → limited updates, Employee → personal info only.
- Data persists in JSON files.
- Access controlled by role.

### What I Learned
- How to model real-world systems with classes.
- Role-based access and authentication
- Organizing code for reusability
- Persistent storage using JSON for object data.
